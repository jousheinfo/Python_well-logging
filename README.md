# Python_well-logging

Well logging is the process of collecting data (e.g.,  porosity, permeability) from the subsurface formation surrounding a wellbore. This process is an essential tool to understand the characteristics of the surface and to optimize the exploration and production of hydrocarbons.

In this repository, you will find the complete Python code for well logging applications, e.g., interactive visualization of the well data for its analysis and interpretation. The well logging data is loaded from LAS-data format.

IMPORTANT!: Please keep in mind that both LAS and Python script files must be saved in the same directory, otherwise you will get an error (unless you specify the folder location of the LAS file in the code).

Please if you have questions, do not hesitate to contact me. Happy Python learning!
